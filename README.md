In this project, I took statistical information from About-Corona.Net API and organize it per continent. The available information for each country is as follows:
- Confirmed Cases
- Number of Deaths
- Number of recovered
- Number of critical condition
- total cases
- new cases
- total deaths
- new deaths
- total recovered
- in critical condition
